Palomino API (PAPI) is the Node.JS API built to extend the functionality of [Palomino](https://github.com/sildotdev/palominorp), a gamemode for Garry's Mod.

Authentication is handled through [PAUTH](https://github.com/sildotdev/pauth).

PAPI implements:
- GET/POST routes for player arrest records
- Routes for retrieving dynamically scaled UI elements, extending GMod's limited UI capabilities
- Game Server, Game Client, and Webclient, authenticated routes through [PAUTH](https://github.com/sildotdev/pauth)  
- Game Server & Player Session handlers via WebSockets

PAPI v2, in TypeScript, can be found [here](https://github.com/Palomino-Roleplay/papi-v2). It was created right before the project was halted.
