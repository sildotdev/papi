Palomino API (PAPI) is the Node.JS API built to extend the functionality of Palomino (https://github.com/sildotdev/palominorp), a gamemode for Garry's Mod.

Authentication is handled through PAUTH (https://github.com/sildotdev/pauth).

PAPI implements:
- GET/POST routes for player arrest records
- Routes for retrieving dynamically scaled UI routes, extending GMod's limited UI capabilities
- Game Server, Webclient, and 
- Game Server & Player Session handlers via WebSockets.

PAPI v2, in TypeScript, can be found here: https://github.com/Palomino-Roleplay/papi-v2
It was created right before the project was halted.
